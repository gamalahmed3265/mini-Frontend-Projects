## This repo implements a sample webpages that displays creative ideas.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three main languages used to create websites.

* **HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to create the structure of a website. HTML defines the content of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and lists.
* **CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style the content of a website. CSS controls the appearance of a page, such as the font, color, and size of text, as well as the layout of elements on the page.
* **JavaScript** is a programming language that can be used to add interactivity to websites. JavaScript can be used to create animations, games, and other interactive elements.

These three languages work together to create dynamic and interactive websites. HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the style, and JavaScript provides the interactivity.

Here are some examples of what you can do with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

* Create a simple website with a few pages and some basic content.
* Design a website with a custom look and feel.
* Add interactivity to your website, such as animations, games, and forms.
* Integrate your website with third-party services, such as social media and payment processing.
